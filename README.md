# GhostUtils - A Go Library for the Ghost CLI tool.
GhostUtils is a Go library that acts as a wrapper for various libraries to simplify the setup of Ghost projects. It provides functionality for loading configuration from a YAML file, creating routes using Gin, and setting up the SurrealDB database. It will also add some features for full-stack web-development in go.

Using the [`ghost` cli](https://github.com/adamkali/GHST) will already include
this library inside of it.
